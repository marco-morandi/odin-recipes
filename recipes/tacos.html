        <h2>Steps</h2> 

        <p>Here are the steps to make the best Mexican birria tacos you will ever taste!</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Start the sauce: Add guajillo, arbol, and ancho chile peppers to the boiling water; boil for 5 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Remove pot from the heat and allow peppers to soak until cool. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Meanwhile, sear the meat: Rinse beef and pat dry with paper towels. Cut beef into chunks if desired, and season with salt and pepper</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5</strong>: Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6</strong>: While the beef is searing, continue the sauce: Line a heavy cast-iron grill pan or griddle with aluminum foil and place over high heat.<br>
                Arrange tomatoes in a single layer on top. Grill until tomato skin is burned on all sides and begins to peel, 3 to 5 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Step 7</strong>: Place cooled chile peppers into a blender. 
                Add grilled tomatoes, vinegar, garlic, 2 teaspoons black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, oregano, and salt in a blender.<br>
                Pour in the reserved 1/4 cup of chile water and blend until smooth</li>
            <li><strong>Step 8</strong>: Strain chile sauce through a mesh strainer and pour over browned meat in the Dutch oven, turning the roast so it is completely covered with sauce; cover with a lid</li>
            <li><strong>Step 9</strong>: Bake in the preheated oven, basting meat every 45 minutes with sauce, until birria begins to fall apart, 3 to 4 hours.<br>
                Remove the lid and bake, uncovered, until birria is crispy on top, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven, cover with 2 layers of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Step 10</strong>: Remove meat to a cutting board and strain off any fat from the sauce. Shred meat with two forks, then return meat to the pot and stir with the sauce to combine</li>
            <li><strong>Step 11</strong>: Assemble and heat tacos: Fill each tortilla with birria and top with Mexican cheese, chopped onion, and cilantro.<br>
                Warm tortillas on a griddle, flipping until both sides are crispy and cheese is melted</li>
            <li><strong>Step 12</strong>: Serve with extra sauce on the side for dipping and enjoy!</li>
